# Clustering Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of various clustering algorithms. It's structured to facilitate exploratory data analysis, algorithm implementation, and evaluation in a clear, modular, and reproducible manner.

This table presents a curated list of clustering algorithms, accompanied by their respective implementation libraries. Each entry specifies the original research paper title that introduced the algorithm, along with the total number of citations received as of January 31, 2024. This citation count serves as an indicator of the algorithm's impact and its recognition within the field. For instance, the influential K-means algorithm was originally introduced in the paper titled "Some methods for classification and analysis of multivariate observations," which has garnered 37,287 citations, evidencing its widespread adoption and foundational status in the realm of clustering analysis.

## Directory Structure

### `notebooks/`

**Purpose**: 
- For exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and presenting methodologies in an interactive format.

**Content**: 
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of functions and classes from the `src` directory. 
- Each notebook is dedicated to a particular part of the analysis or a specific clustering algorithm.

**Reproducibility**: 
- Serves as an interactive report, showcasing findings and insights in a format accessible to those not involved in the codebase's development.

### `src/`

**Purpose**: 
- Houses the core Python code, including functions, classes, and constants â€“ the backbone of the project.

**Content**: 
- Modular, reusable code for data preprocessing, algorithm implementations, and evaluation metrics.
- This code is essential for the functionality within the Jupyter notebooks.

**Maintainability**: 
- Facilitates easier maintenance, testing, and reuse of code. 
- Tailored for 'behind-the-scenes' tasks like algorithm optimization and code refactoring.

### Importance of Separation:
- **Separation of Concerns**: This structure maintains a clear distinction between interactive analysis (`notebooks`) and core code functionality (`src`).
- **Reusability and Scalability**: Promotes reusability of code and scalability of the project. As the project grows, this separation ensures manageability.
- **Collaboration-Friendly**: Addresses version control challenges with notebooks and allows for more traditional software development practices in `src`.

### `results/figures/`

**Purpose**: 
- Dedicated space for storing visual outputs like charts, graphs, and plots.

**Benefits**:
- Centralizes all visualizations for easy access and reference.
- Facilitates integration of visuals into reports and presentations.

### `results/metrics/`

**Purpose**: 
- For storing quantitative evaluation results, such as performance metrics of different algorithms.

**Benefits**:
- Centralizes performance metrics for comparative analysis and historical tracking.
- Aids in the aggregation and analysis of performance data.
