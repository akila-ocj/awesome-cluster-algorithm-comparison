# Clustering Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of various clustering algorithms. It's structured to facilitate exploratory data analysis, algorithm implementation, and evaluation in a clear, modular, and reproducible manner.

## Directory Structure

### `notebooks/`

**Purpose**: 
- For exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and presenting methodologies in an interactive format.

**Content**: 
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of functions and classes from the `src` directory. 
- Each notebook is dedicated to a particular part of the analysis or a specific clustering algorithm.

**Reproducibility**: 
- Serves as an interactive report, showcasing findings and insights in a format accessible to those not involved in the codebase's development.

### `src/`

**Purpose**: 
- Houses the core Python code, including functions, classes, and constants â€“ the backbone of the project.

**Content**: 
- Modular, reusable code for data preprocessing, algorithm implementations, and evaluation metrics.
- This code is essential for the functionality within the Jupyter notebooks.

**Maintainability**: 
- Facilitates easier maintenance, testing, and reuse of code. 
- Tailored for 'behind-the-scenes' tasks like algorithm optimization and code refactoring.

### Importance of Separation:
- **Separation of Concerns**: This structure maintains a clear distinction between interactive analysis (`notebooks`) and core code functionality (`src`).
- **Reusability and Scalability**: Promotes reusability of code and scalability of the project. As the project grows, this separation ensures manageability.
- **Collaboration-Friendly**: Addresses version control challenges with notebooks and allows for more traditional software development practices in `src`.

### `results/figures/`

**Purpose**: 
- Dedicated space for storing visual outputs like charts, graphs, and plots.

**Benefits**:
- Centralizes all visualizations for easy access and reference.
- Facilitates integration of visuals into reports and presentations.

### `results/metrics/`

**Purpose**: 
- For storing quantitative evaluation results, such as performance metrics of different algorithms.

**Benefits**:
- Centralizes performance metrics for comparative analysis and historical tracking.
- Aids in the aggregation and analysis of performance data.
